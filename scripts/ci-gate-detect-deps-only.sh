# ci-gate-detect-deps-only.sh — invoked by the `changes` job in _ci-gate.yml.
#
# Feeds the opt-in `nix_skip_deps_only` toggle: writes `is-deps-only=true` to
# $GITHUB_OUTPUT when the PR looks like a pure dependency bump, so callers can
# skip `nix-validate`/`nix-build` on it (still overridden by a flake.lock
# change — see `is-flake-lock-change` in the same job).
#
#   - Renovate: author + chore(deps) title (dual check since Renovate can also
#     open non-dependency PRs).
#   - Dependabot: author check alone (it exclusively opens dependency PRs).
#
# The Renovate author was `jacobpevans-github-actions*`, which no pull request
# has ever carried: every dependency PR in this org is opened by the Renovate
# GitHub App, whose `user.login` is `renovate[bot]`. So this always answered
# `false` and the toggle it feeds had never skipped anything. Verified against
# 21 `chore(deps` PRs across three repos — all `app/renovate`, none matching.
# A detector that cannot fire looks identical to one that decided not to.
#
# AUTHOR/COMMIT_MSG are empty on non-pull_request events, which safely
# evaluates to is-deps-only=false (never skip).
#
# Required env:
#   AUTHOR      — github.event.pull_request.user.login
#   COMMIT_MSG  — github.event.pull_request.title
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT — GitHub Actions output file (set by the runner)

# --self-check: exercise both answers without a runner. Guards the author
# literals, which is the part that rotted — a wrong one still exits 0 and
# reports "not a dependency PR" forever.
