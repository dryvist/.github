# ci-gate-watchdog.sh — invoked by the `watchdog` job in _ci-gate.yml.
#
# Watch the run's sibling jobs for the whole run. Cancel the run if any job still
# waiting for a runner (`queued`, `pending` or `requested`) is older than
# QUEUE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES, measured per job from its created_at. Exit 0 once every
# sibling is `completed`. The Actions API does not expose job cancellation;
# cancelling the run keeps an incomplete check set from passing.
#
# The watchdog no longer exits at the first moment nothing is queued: jobs created
# later in the run (matrix legs, called workflows) and jobs reported as `pending`
# would go unwatched. It therefore lives as long as the run. On GitHub-hosted
# runners siblings finish in minutes, so it still exits as soon as the last one
# completes. `waiting` (environment approval) is not a runner queue and is never
# cancelled, but it keeps the watchdog polling until the job's timeout-minutes
# ceiling. "Queue Watchdog" (this job) and "Merge Gate" (awaiting this job) are
# exempt; their state here is intentional. Inside a called workflow GitHub
# prefixes job names ("nix / Merge Gate"), so the exemption matches the last
# " / " segment, which also exempts sibling watchdogs from other gate calls.
#
# Required env:
#   GH_TOKEN              — GitHub token with actions:write on the run
#   QUEUE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES — minutes a job may wait for a runner before the run is cancelled
#   REPO                  — owner/repo of the current workflow run
#   RUN_ID                — workflow run id
# Optional env:
#   WATCH_MAX_MINUTES     — minutes after which the watchdog stops watching and exits 0
#                           (default 55; keep it below the job's timeout-minutes)
