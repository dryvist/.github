# ci-gate-watchdog.sh — invoked by the `watchdog` job in _ci-gate.yml.
#
# After QUEUE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES, cancels every sibling job in the current
# workflow run that is still in `queued` state, except for "Queue Watchdog"
# (this script's own job) and "Merge Gate" (the gate job, which is still
# pending here because `needs: watchdog`). Cancellation forces a terminal
# state so `gate` can finally schedule and `re-actors/alls-green` can
# evaluate, ensuring the required `Merge Gate` status always reports.
#
# Required env:
#   GH_TOKEN              — GitHub token with actions:write on the run
#   QUEUE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES — minutes to wait before evaluating queued jobs
#   REPO                  — owner/repo of the current workflow run
#   RUN_ID                — workflow run id
